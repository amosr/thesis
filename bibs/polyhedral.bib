% Semi-interactive method of directing polyhedral fusion.
% A loop nest is transformed, giving the resulting code as well as a 
% transformation script describing what was performed.
% This transformation script can be modified by the programmer, in order to
% find the desired schedule.

% Conservative (overestimate) approximations of dependencies allow them to express
% dynamic control flow while describing the loop with affine dependencies.
% While loops are transformed into for loops with breaks.
