\CHAPTERX{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisors Ben, Gabi, and Manuel.
At various stages of my candidature, all three have moved on from the University of New South Wales.
Despite their new positions and their busy schedules, they have continued to teach and guide me.
Their selfless dedication has made this thesis possible.

I would like to thank my cohort in the former Programming and Language Systems group at the University of New South Wales, including Josh, Liam, Rob, Trevor, and Zilin.
For many years, up until its recent disbandment, the group had formed a vital part of the Sydney functional programming community.

% I believe that this group, along with the Functional Programming user group of Sydney (FP-Syd), form the foundations of the Sydney functional programming community.
% I am lucky to be a part of such a welcoming community.

I would like to thank my former colleagues at Ambiata, in particular Jacob, Mark, and Tran.
My manager Mark recognised that, for a company whose purpose is to give correct advice, correct programs are essential.
As obvious as this insight may seem, Mark's unwavering commitment to correctness was a refreshing change from my previous industry experience.

Finally, I would like to thank my partner Laurel, my dear friend James, and the rest of my family.
