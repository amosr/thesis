\chapter{Processes and combinators}
\label{chapter:process:processes}


A \emph{process} in our system is a simple imperative program with a local heap. A process pulls source values from an arbitrary number of input streams and pushes result values to at least one output stream. The process language is an intermediate representation we use when fusing the overall dataflow network. When describing the fusion transform we describe the control flow of the process as a state machine, hence Machine Fusion. 

A \emph{combinator} is a template for a process which parameterizes it over the particular input and output streams, as well as values of configuration parameters such as the worker function used in a @map@ process. Each process implements a logical \emph{operator} --- so we use ``operator'' when describing the values being computed, but ``process'' and ``machine'' when referring to the implementation.
