\section{Related work}
Meta-Repa \cite{ankner2013edsl} also uses Template Haskell for code generation, and provides a similar distinction between typed interface and untyped code generation.
It provides a generalised abstract datatype (GADT) for its typed interface rather than using typed Template Haskell.
It was implemented before typed Template Haskell.
