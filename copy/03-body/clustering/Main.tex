This chapter presents a clustering algorithm for scheduling array programs, where the programs may perform multiple passes over input or intermediate arrays.
% This chapter presents a clustering algorithm for scheduling array programs, which can perform multiple passes over input arrays, and introduce intermediate arrays.
This work was first published as \citet{robinson2014fusing}.

In the streaming models we have seen so far, all streams are \emph{ephemeral}: once the elements have been read, they cannot be recovered unless they are explicitly materialized into buffers.
Input streams such as those that read from a network socket are ephemeral, but arrays stored in memory or in secondary storage can be re-read any number of times.
For array computations, intermediate and output arrays can be stored and re-read as well.
Array computations that perform multiple passes over input or intermediate arrays can be executed as multiple streaming programs.
We execute each pass as its own streaming process network, fused by the process fusion algorithm from \cref{chapter:process:processes}, with the input streams being read from arrays, and the output streams written to arrays.
For a given array computation, we perform \emph{clustering} to determine how many passes to perform, and how to schedule the individual array operations that comprise the array computation among the different passes.
There are generally many possible clusterings, and the choice of clustering can affect runtime performance.
To minimise the time spent reading and re-reading the data, we would like to use a clustering with as few as possible array traversals and intermediate arrays.
We use \emph{integer linear programming} (ILP), a mathematical optimisation technique, to find the best clustering according to our cost model.

The contributions of this chapter are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
We identify an opportunity for improvement over existing imperative clustering algorithms, which do not allow \emph{size-changing operators} such as \Hs/filter/ to be assigned to the same cluster as operations that consume the output array (\cref{clustering:s:Introduction});

\item   
We extend the clustering algorithm of \citet{megiddo1998optimal} and \citet{darte2002contraction} with support for size-changing operators.
In our system, size-changing operators can be assigned to the same cluster as operations that process their input and output arrays (\cref{clustering:s:ILP});

\item
We present a simplification to constraint generation that is also applicable to some ILP formulations such as Megiddo's:
constraints between two nodes need not be generated if there is a fusion-preventing path between the two (\cref{clustering:s:OptimisedConstraints});

\item
Our constraint system encodes the cost model as a total ordering on the cost of clusterings, expressed using weights on the integer linear program.
For example, we encode that memory traffic is more expensive than the overhead of performing a separate pass, so given a choice between the two, memory traffic will be reduced (\cref{clustering:s:ObjectiveFunction});

\item
We present benchmarks of our algorithm applied to several common programming patterns.
Our algorithm is complete and finds the optimal clustering for the chosen cost model, which yields good results in practice.
A cost model which maps exactly to program runtime performance is infeasible in general (\cref{clustering:s:Benchmarks}).
\end{itemize}

% The key to compiling functional, collection oriented array programs into efficient code is to minimise memory traffic.
% Simply fusing subsequent array operations into a single computation is not sufficient; we also need to cluster \emph{separate} traversals of the same array into a single traversal.
% Previous work demonstrated how Integer Linear Programming (ILP) can be used to cluster the operators in a general data-flow graph into subgraphs, which can be individually fused.
% However, these approaches can only handle operations which preserve the size of the array, thereby missing out on some optimisation opportunities.
% This paper addresses this shortcoming by extending the ILP approach with support for size-changing operations, using an external ILP solver to find good clusterings.
