\part{Icicle: Using types to ensure fusion}
\label{part:icicle}

\input{copy/03-body/icicle/style/utils.tex}

We present Icicle, a pure streaming query language which statically guarantees that multiple queries over the same input stream are fused. We use a modal type system to ensure that fused queries can be computed incrementalally, and a fold-based intermediate language to compile down to efficient C code. We present production benchmarks demonstrating significant speedup over existing queries written in R, and on par with the Unix tools \texttt{grep} and \texttt{wc}.
